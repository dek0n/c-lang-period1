CSV reader
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are a common way to store tabular data, making them a
valuable format for data interchange between applications. Write a program that reads house
temperature data from a CSV-file and prints a horizontal bar graph of the temperature in the selected
room. The CSV file starts with a header row and then continues with lines of comma separated data.
The header row contains two titles: Room and Temperature. Data lines contain room name and the
temperature separated by commas.

Program must ask user to select a room and then print the temperatures with one decimal precision
followed with a bar graph using dashes (-). Each dash corresponds to 0.5 centigrade and
temperatures in the range of 0 â€“ 30 are printed as horizontal bars. Temperatures that are outside or
the range are printed as a single X on the left. If the selected room does not exist then program must
print an error message.

For example, (not based on the data above):
Bedroom
20.4 ----------------------------------------
22.5 -------------------------------------------
21.4 ------------------------------------------
21.6 -----------------------------------------
32.3 X
18.2 ------------------------------------
18.8 -------------------------------------
19.5 --------------------------------------
21.3 -----------------------------------------
